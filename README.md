This Python application is a portfolio analysis tool that consolidates coursework from this quarter. It reads stock and bond data from files, computes earnings, yields, and yearly returns; stores data in an SQLite database; exports reports and CSV summaries; provides an interactive command-line filter; and visualizes values from a JSON data source.
